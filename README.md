## Welcome to my github project!

This is the demo code of the react antive secure messaging app that I created.

You need to install react native (and node if not installed yet). See more installation instructions here: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html

After everything is set, cd into the folder and run:

### `npm install`

to install the node_modules package and all the libraries needed.

Because this is the demo code, and you not be able to log in to chat unless I create a test account for you.

But I've created a demo video that walks through how the app works here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5NAbTjH5G8&t=2s
